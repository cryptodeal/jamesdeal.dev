		Machine Learning
	</h3>
	<p>
		In an era dominated by big data, the value in Machine Learning cannot be understated. Data is
		only as useful insofar as it can be used in the pursuit of knowledge or as a means to some other
		end. Machine Learning can help us to analyze trends in the data and, a properly trained model,
		can be used to make predictions with near or superior than human results.

		I've worked with Tensorflow in the past, but have recently begun to explore applied
		neuroevolutionary concepts to neural networks in node. Drawing inspiration from project such as: <a

		>,
		<a href="https://github.com/digitsensitive/neuroevolution-typescript#readme"
			>neuroevolution-typescript</a
		>, and <a href="https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning">Flappy Learning</a>.
